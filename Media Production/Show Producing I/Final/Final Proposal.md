## Narrative
**_A Day in Your Life: College_**
### Overview
_A Day in Your Life: College_ is a series of _Choose Your Own Adventure_ style episodes where the viewer is able to navigate between a series of short videos that comprise a day-in-the-life of a college student. A single “episode” is comprised of several short videos that rely on video hosting website _YouTube_’s end-cards that link to other videos, which represent choices that the viewer can act on. Some choices may lead the viewer down a string of comparatively boring outcomes, while others may feature adventures in Burlington, and the choice is completely up to the viewer’s whim. To allow this to become a series, each episode features different opportunities for the viewer to explore, such as on-campus activities, differences in classes, Burlington events, and more. 

### Target Audience
_A Day in Your Life_: _College_, while appealing to a greater audience, targets those between the ages of 16-22 who are looking to attend college. During a poll for what potential audiences would like to see, non-fiction needs to be more fun and engaging, with unique takes on older formulas. The assist in uniqueness and engagement, a _Choose Your Own Adventure_ style was selected since it is rarely used in a video format, and helps to tailor the show towards one’s own preferences. Additionally, _A Day in Your Life: College_ serves to be an educational experience about what the life of a college student can be, depending on the choices an individual makes.

### Timeliness
Given the target audience, it is important that the show is released as high school students are approaching their arrival to college. The release time is important because while many students are certain they want to go to college, they are equally uncertain about what life as a college student can be. This is often a problem for Residential Advisors who then scramble to tell students what freedoms students have, like no curfew, doing one’s own laundry, and being self motivated to do classwork. Different actions can have different consequences, which can inform students on how to better divide their time to become strong college students.

### Significance
There are two major aspects to the significance of _A Day in Your Life: College_: content and format. The content of the show, while evergreen, is important for college students since college for most is a wildly different experience from what students experience so far in their lives. It is helpful to have insight on how to learn navigating higher education, especially since it is rare that a person goes into a situation with absolute no insight. Secondly, the format of the show is important for media as a whole. There is usually a strict divide between games and video, however _A Day in Your Life: College_ is interactive while not being a game. 

### Exclusivity
The idea of a _Choose Your Own Adventure_ is not uncommon, but applying it to a full show is extremely rare, with one of the only comparative examples being _A Heist with Markiplier_, and _In Space with Markiplier_, which both tell an entire end-to-end story, not relying on a episodic format. While the content is not necessarily exclusive, the format and appeal both serve to separate the show from other available content. This exclusivity is likely to remain for an extended period of time because of the researched and equipment required to ensure various qualities of the show, such as a head mounted camera.

### Treatment
#### Character Breakdown
##### You - Main Character
In this story, you are the main character, and make decisions that direct the story. This is your first year at Champlain College as an undeclared major in the sciences, and are attempting to balance classes, sleep, homework, and a social life. You interact with various characters that may attempt to influence you, but the large choices, like studying, are still in your hands. Different options have different benefits and consequences, studying prepares you, but you might also be getting tired during class. Alternatively, hanging out with friends may be fun, but you might not ace that next exam. You learn for yourself what is important in college, and understand college from different perspectives.

##### The RA
The RA lives alongside you, able to give advice, but isn't within your typical social circle. Because of the social circle issue, the RA doesn't appear often, if the viewer chooses correctly, the RA is available to provide advice about how to navigate education, and social circles. The RA is a character can only appear under two circumstances: the viewer specifically chooses to talk to the RA, or the RA is told about struggles the viewer is having.

##### AJ (tentative name)
AJ is a social butterfly at Champlain, an consequently is one of your first friends. He occasionally has others around him, but largely serves to be a constant face in the production. AJ is very lax, and encourages you to hangout, potentially limiting how much you can study or sleep, making academics potentially more difficult. Though it's because of AJ that mental health can remain stable, and college is more enjoyable.


#### Scene Descriptions
$\qquad$Starting the story, you just finished orientation, and it is the day before classes begin, and are introduced to AJ, and your new hall: Carriage House. After hanging out with some friends in the common area, you head to bed. You wake up to your alarm going off... late for class. The first choice arises: getting yourself put together, or go to class with nothing more than a change of clothes.
$\qquad$The viewer chooses to go with the bare minimum, and head to your first class in Joyce hall. The professor is going over the syllabus, and there is a specific section about needing to self care and cleanliness. A student shouts out about how gamers and programmers have a reputation for not showering, and often times smell bad. Classmates react, but it seems your classmates don’t notice how haphazardly you put yourself together. After class, you go back to Carriage, and  clean yourself up. AJ and some others meet up with you to get lunch at IDX where the next choice appears: fish or chicken patty.
$\qquad$The viewer chooses to go with chicken patty. You go to a table, and AJ turns to you to say that you were smart to get the chicken patty and that there’s a lot of people who get sick off of the fish. You look to the side to see someone running out of IDX holding their stomach. After lunch, you head straight to your next class where it’s another syllabus reading, but homework is assigned. You head back to Carriage, where AJ is pushing you to play some video games, though it would be beneficial to start in on homework.
$\qquad$The viewer chooses to do homework, and predictably, it’s boring. You hear laughter from outside your door, and are starting to get tired. Looking at the clock, it’s starting to get late, and your notes are really light. Should you go to bed?
The viewer chooses to stay up and make some immaculate notes. You go to class the next day with little sleep, and there’s a pop quiz, and you do amazingly! You have another class immediately after, and as the professor teaches, it’s getting progressively more difficult to pay attention. Class wraps up, and you go to hang out with AJ. AJ’s happy to hang out, and you head down to the lake for a walk. While you’re walking, it gets harder to hear AJ, and it’s getting difficult to keep your eyes open. You make it through the walk, and you retire early today. It’s Wednesday now, and to celebrate hump day, AJ’s hoping you’re willing to skip class today. After all, it’s reasonable to miss a few classes. Do you skip?
$\qquad$The viewer chooses to attend your coding class, since time together can also be arranged around class. You go to class and find that a small project has been assigned, and a lot of really helpful details were provided in-class that you later find missing online. With these tips in mind, you were able to almost completely finish the project in-class, saving you lots of time later. After class, you meet up with AJ and play video games for hours. You crushed him in every conceivable way, and get dinner. You get back to the hall, and get off to bed. The next day you find a Nerf gun outside your door. It’s full of darts, and you hear another Nerf gun loading downstairs. You hustle down with the blaster and get firing. You’re having tons of fun, but the RA appears and isn’t too happy about the word “gun” being used so liberally. Do you shoot the RA, or blast the RA?
$\qquad$After the viewer chooses to blast the RA, the RA cracks a smirk and pulls out a blaster of their own and begins to open fire on you and AJ. It is full on chaos, but in all the best ways. You all go crazy all day, firing every Nerf round you could get your hands on. Though it’s finally time to eat. Do you go to IDX or try out this fancy CRU5H place on campus?
$\qquad$The viewer chooses to go to CRU5H, and after struggling with the card swipe, grabs their food from the counter. You sit next to AJ and eat some chicken tenders. While talking to AJ he mentions that he’s been too busy having fun to be attending classes, so he only has gone to a single class so far, and it is the fourth day of classes. You try to tell AJ that he’s spending a ton of money to be here, but he’s persistent about college needing to be fun. You two pack up and head back to Carriage. Do you tell the RA about AJ’s missed classes?
$\qquad$You choose to tell the RA about it, and the conversation lasts a short while, and by the end, the RA is very thankful you told them, and that the RA can play it off as if the Area Coordinator told them about it. You head to bed and wakeup to knocking on your door. It’s AJ, and he’s mad that you told the RA about him missing classes. You tell AJ that you weren’t the one, that the Area Coordinator told the RA. He believes you, and says he’ll start going to classes since that forced conversation was cringy and really brought down the mood. AJ walks away, and you start heading off to class. While in class, you look out into the hallway, and true to his word, AJ is walking to class. You leave class, and meet with AJ who goes off about how dull classes are, but he finishes it all mentioning how he is paying for his education, and he should take advantage of it. You go to bed ready for the next week.

#### Reasons
Two of the most important aspects of the show are camera work and editing. Camera development will be needed to allow for a head-mounted camera that meets the eye line of the camera operator. The camera operator will also have to be dealing with some amount of physical strain while attempting to manage the camera, and be an actor. Secondly, editing is a critical role to the Choose-Your-Own-Adventure will require a strong team of editors to ensure that match cuts are seamless. Match cuts may need to be used creatively, merging two shots together with similar camera moves, allowing reusage of footage and outcomes.

### Distribution
The distribution platform for *A Day in Your Life: College* is YouTube as motivated by data, and available features. The audience for *A Dan in Your Life: College* is young, and is meant to be seen as people are going to college, which means that the show needs to be as accessible as possible. YouTube offers this, since it is available online without any need for a subscription like television, which people, especially young people, are abandoning. Secondly, the feature set of YouTube allows for the choose your own adventure. Platforms like Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, HBO MAX, and even television lack the ability to embed links to other videos, making a choose-your-own-adventure impossible on those platforms.
