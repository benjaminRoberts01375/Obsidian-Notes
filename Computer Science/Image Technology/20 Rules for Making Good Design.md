*Rules can be broken – but never ignored.*
1. **Have a concept**
	- Needs some kind of idea or message.
2. **Communicate, don't decorate**
	- Do more than just "that looks nice". Why is it there, what is it trying to say?
3. **Be universal**
	- Few people are actually "in the know"
		- Think MLK arms, not everyone knew they were his, and it's problematic.
		- Speak to the world at lasrge
4. **Speak with one visual voice**
	- Make sure nothing feels disconnected
	- Be consistent
5. **If you can do it with less, then do it**
	- Don't crowd design with elements, be elegant
	- It can be difficult to interpret when things are too crowded
6. **Create space, don't fill it
	- Let's your content breathe
	- Calls attention to what's there
7. **Give 'em the one-two punch**
	- Bring viewers' attention to one important big shape/color/image first
	- Follow up with coloring that fits in more
8. **Beware of symmetry**
	- Symmetry's nice until it's not
		- It can be done wrong really easily
	- Can feel static/flat
	- Perceived as "traditional" or even lazy and not neccessarily "relevant"
9. **Fight the flatness**
	- Give a sense of depth
	- Overlay shapes and images
	- Give contrast
10. **Pick colors on purpose**
	- Know what colors do/mean
		- They can carry pyschological and emotional meaning, and can vary between cultures and groups
11. **Less color is more**
	- Too much color can make things look like a circus
12. **Master the dark and the light**
	- Use a range of colors from dark to light
	- Bring together the dark and light areas

	- Typography is useless if it cannot be read
		- Choose typefaces that a granda could read
	- Transmit info
14. **Use two typeface familes, maxiumum**
	- Use three at worst
	- A single typeface with varying weights can do just fine
15. **Treat type as you would image**
	- Typically bland or separated from images
	- Make the text fit in with images
16. **Avoid redundant redundancies**
	- Allow the image and text to show different info
17. **Create images – don't scavenge**
	- Be original, make something original, or pay someone to express your originality
	- Not everything needs to be crazy over-the-top colorful
18. **Look to history, but don't repeat it**
	- Explore past approaches, but don't carbon copy them
	- Get inspired!
19. **Ignore fashion**
	- Fashion and style are different
	- Brands may have a particular style that differs from what's "trendy"
20. **Be decisive: do it on purpose, or not at all**
	- Be fast, be bold, have intent
