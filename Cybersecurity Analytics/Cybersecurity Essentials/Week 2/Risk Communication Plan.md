# Introduction

## Purpose and Scope

This NIST complaint risk communication plan has been developed to address the need for the improvement of cybersecurity measures at the financial institute of Champlain Online Demo Company (CODC). Due to recent cyber-attacks which have compromised data, caused financial losses, and lost user trust, it is urgent to rapidly improve CODC’s cybersecurity measures to regain this lost ground. The purpose of this plan is to communicate the importance of risk management/mitigation for all stakeholders, internal and external, to create a comprehensive understanding of our cybersecurity position, and steps being taken moving forward to rebuild while being better posed for future attacks in an evolving landscape.

## Challenges

CODC is currently facing several challenges in the wake of recent security breaches, such as a damaged reputation and consumer confidence, reduced market share, exposure for regulatory scrutiny and compliance concerns, continued threats, and the need for an organizational culture shift. These challenges if left unattended each could have severe financial, digital, and moral losses for CODC, and due to the severity should be addressed as soon as possible to preserve the current functionality of CODC. Finally consumer trust is unlikely to repaired in the short term, and shareholders may not immediately take notice of internal restructuring, thus may require multiple reminders to internal and external stakeholders about the changes being implemented.

## Outcomes

Through this risk communication plan, CODC plans to restore stakeholder trust, increase awareness of cybersecurity risks across the entire organization, foster a culture of shared responsibility and risk mitigation, demonstrate CODC’s commitment to transparency and proactive risk management, and begin regaining the lost market share due to these leaks. In doing so, CODC will be better positioned to survive and thrive against future cyber-attacks, while also having avenues to inform stakeholders if a leak reoccurs.

This risk communication plan will utilize the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework as its foundation. The NIST framework provides a comprehensive approach to managing and reducing cybersecurity risk, organized around the five core functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. By aligning our communication efforts with this widely recognized framework, we ensure a structured and effective approach to conveying the significance of risk management and mitigation to our stakeholders.

The subsequent sections of this plan will detail our strategy for stakeholder analysis, risk messaging, communication channels, timeline, key messages, and evaluation mechanisms. Through this comprehensive approach, we aim to not only address the immediate concerns stemming from recent incidents but also to establish a long-term foundation for robust cybersecurity practices and communication within our institution.

# Stakeholder Analysis

Effective communication surrounding risk requires a deep understanding of key stakeholders who need to be engaged in the risk communication process. However at the bottom line is CODC’s customers, who have entrusted their personal data including transactions and banking information to CODC. These individuals are primarily concerned about their assets and personal information, and their trust is required for CODC’s continued operation.

Similar to customers are shareholders and investors, who form another critical group as they have a vested interest in CODC’s sustainability, profitability, reputation, and long-term goals. Additionally, this group of stakeholders are partially able to control the financials of CODC, making their perception of CODC verses its competitors a crucial aspect to the survival of the company. Finally some investors are able to directly influence each other, creating a cascading effect during shareholder meetings.

Internally at CODC, employees across all departments pay a vital role in implementing and maintaining a secure framework. Starting with front line staff who directly work with customer data, these staff often work as the face of CODC, leaving some consumers to believe their leaked data is that representative’s fault, thus these representative may have to workaround increased hostility from consumers. Also internally are senors management and IT personnel who are responsible for company direction and system security. These groups, including representatives, required tailored communication to specify their responsibilities and role within the cybersecurity framework at CODC. Finally, The Board of Directors, with their oversight responsibilities, need comprehensive information to make informed decisions about risk management policies and resource allocation.

Regulatory bodies represent another key stakeholder group, as they have the authority to penalize CODC for leaking data and for non-compliance with cybersecurity systems standards. Clear communication with regulators demonstrates our commitment to meeting and exceeding industry standards, while also being able to better security outside of CODC.

Each of these stakeholder groups has varying levels of influence and interest in CODC’s cybersecurity efforts. The communication strategy must take into account these differences, tailoring our messages and channels to effectively reach and engage each group. By doing this, an understanding and importance of risk management/mitigation can strength CODC’s cybersecurity position.

# Risk Messaging

To communicate effectively to stakeholders, clear and concise tailored messages about risk management and mitigation. CODC’s messaging will focus on messages that highlight the potential impact of cybersecurity risks on each stakeholder's specific interests and concerns. Additionally, this messaging will remain available for others to look back on and review to gain better clarity to the direction CODC takes for cybersecurity.

Customers will receive messaging surrounding CODC’s commitment to security, and protecting their financial assets and personal information. Communication will include newly implemented or planned measures towards account security and authentication. This messaging will also highlight the importance of customer vigilance, both with CODC and third party companies. Finally, messaging to customers will include best account practices, like having unique passwords stored securely and enabling two-factor authentication.

Shareholder and investor communication focuses on the long-term value add from robust cybersecurity measures. Particularly, this messaging surrounds cutting-edge security technologies and processes not only protects against immediate threats but also positions us for sustainable growth in an increasingly digital financial landscape. The messaging will draw clear connections between strong cybersecurity practices and financial stability, emphasizing how these efforts safeguard the CODC’s market position and shareholder value.

Messaging for employees will orbit around shared responsibility, and furthering individual education around cybersecurity. While IT is able to make a significant contribution towards cybersecurity, cybersecurity can quickly fall apart when an employee unknowingly opens the door for a malicious actor. Messages will highlight specific actions each department and individual can take to contribute to our overall security posture, from proper handling of sensitive information to recognizing and reporting potential phishing attempts. This messaging will conclude the personal stake each employee has in the institution's cybersecurity, linking it to job security and professional growth opportunities.

When communicating with government regulators, demonstrating a proactive approach to risk management and compliance will demonstrate progress moving forward, and the likelihood of a breach occurring decreasing. The messaging will specifically call out the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, and emphasize how it guides the CODC’s commitment towards hardening security, and providing clear and digestible messaging if a breach occurs.

This risk messaging helps to emphasize the dynamic and difficult landscape of operating in a market that is as internet dependent as financing is. While operating in this landscape, every link of the chain from consumer to business needs to have measures in place to ensure security of the entire system to prevent breaches and leaks of sensitive data. By tailoring messages to each stakeholder group’s interests and concerns, CODC aims to create a shared understanding of the importance of digital infrastructure and safeguards.

# Communication Channels

To effectively communicate with stakeholders, a variety of tailored communication channels should be deployed. Customers will be communicated to via email notifications, website and app updates, and social media posts. The focus on social media would contain alerts for when updates are rolled out, as well as cybersecurity tips for the consumer.

Secondly internal stakeholders, including employees and the Board of Directors, will be reached through face-to-face meetings, town halls, regular email updates, and a dedicated intranet portal for cybersecurity resources. Internal stakeholders will also take part in workshops or training sessions to ensure continuous education.

Shareholders and investors will be informed through formal channels such as annual reports, shareholder meetings, and investor relations briefings, supplemented by regular updates in our investor newsletter.

For regulatory bodies, CODC will maintain open communication through formal written reports, face-to-face meetings, and prompt responses to inquiries, along with proactive updates on our cybersecurity initiatives and compliance efforts. This will ensure a friendly relationship with government regulators, educating officials on how to stay secure, hold CODC to industry standards, and potentially have minor influence over future regulation.

# Risk Communication

The risk communication timeline would take place over a 12 month period, divided into three key phases: immediate response and trust rebuilding, educational and cultural shift, and documenting progress and future planning. These phases will help to ensure that clear goals are outlined to internal employees, as well as external consumers to track internal progress.

Phase one, which lasts three months focuses on immediate response and trust rebuilding. During this time, CODC will issue a series of public statements addressing the recent security incidents, outline our short-term mitigation strategies, and introduce the enhanced commitment to enhanced cybersecurity measures. Additionally CODC will conduct internal briefings for all employees, hold emergency board meetings, and initiate direct communications with affected customers and regulatory bodies.

Once phase one completes, a six month long phase begins where a focus on education and cultural shift begins. During this employees will see new cybersecurity training programs as well as a launch of a customer awareness campaign. This campaign will promote using unique passwords, checking for HTTPS, what data to store in a password manager, and what a VPN actually is versus what it is promoted to be.

Finally for phase 3, CODC will track and report progress, and future planning will begin. During this phase, public milestones about cybersecurity improves will also begin on the website and during shareholder and investor meetings. IT tools will be used to check internal tools to ensure best security practices which will be a part of the initial report roll-out. Throughout all phases, there will be many opportunities for consumers and employees alike to answer questions and make security suggestions.

# Key Messages and Talking Points

CODC’s talking points will revolve around three central themes: acknowledgment, action, and assurance. Communication will start with an acknowledgment and seriousness of recent cybersecurity incidents and their impact on specific stakeholders will be made clear. Next, communication about decisive action to the strengthen security framework will be highlighted. Finally assure stakeholders of the unwavering commitment to safeguarding their interests and rebuilding trust through transparency and continuous improvement.

Specific talking points will include: "We have implemented a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, ensuring a robust approach to identifying, protecting against, detecting, responding to, and recovering from cyber-threats." "Our investment in cutting-edge security technologies and employee training demonstrates our commitment to staying ahead of evolving cyber-risks." "We are fostering a culture of shared responsibility for cybersecurity, where every employee, partner, and customer plays a crucial role in maintaining our collective security."

For different stakeholder groups, we will emphasize relevant points: For customers "Your financial security is our top priority. We have strengthened our systems to provide you with the most secure banking experience possible." For employees "You are our first line of defense who works with sensitive data. Your vigilance and adherence to security protocols are critical to our success." For regulators "We are not just meeting, but exceeding industry standards for cybersecurity, setting a new benchmark for the financial sector." These key messages and talking points will be regularly reviewed and updated to ensure they remain relevant and effective in communicating our cybersecurity stance.

## Evaluation and Feedback Mechanisms

To ensure an effective upgrade to CODC’s cybersecurity measures, an evaluation strategy will be implemented to determine what works well for various stakeholders, as well as where security gets in the way of day-to-day operations. Quarterly surveys will be conducted to ensure communication is clear and that it makes the desired impact. These surveys allow supervisors to determine if progress is being made, and where messaging might be lacking.

In addition to surveys, representatives from differing stakeholder groups may come together to compare notes between groups, to raise concerns and answer questions. A more in-depth discussion can be made about cybersecurity, but also other aspects of CODC to give context to the importance of each section of CODC. For employees, continuous feedback through a portal on the internal network will be created to get instantaneous feedback as security measures are rolled out.

To measure the impact of this plan, key performance indicators will be used to track customer retention rates, security compliance, and reported security incidents. Social media will be monitored for sentiment to gauge perception, and ultimately be used to ensure a better CODC for all those inclined. This approach ensures that CODC’s efforts evolve with the changing landscape.
