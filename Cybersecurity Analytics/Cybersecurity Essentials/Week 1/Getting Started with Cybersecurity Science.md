# Transcript
So the talk I'm going to give to you today is about using science to understand and sort of improve the Practical real world that people in the cybersecurity cybersecurity community, use in their tools and in their practices. These are really widely useful Concepts. Whether you're doing security for a global social media website, or a Fortune 500 company or for the brand new company. You're starting in your garage. These these concepts are very widely applicable. You should think, as a cybersecurity practitioner science, is a way for you to explore your own curiosity about how things work and to discover things that are unexpected and most importantly to improve your work.

So, I'm going to talk broadly about these five categories. I'll give you just a few things about me. So you understand where I'm coming from? We'll talk about why cybersecurity science is important, and why you should care about it. Sort of some details about what cybersecurity science is and how it applies to your life. We'll talk about some specific details about how you can incorporate the scientific method into your own daily life. And then at the end, I'll go through a case study which is we'll talk about a very particular example, in digital forensics and walk through how you would apply the scientific method in that particular domain.

So here's a good email address for me. If you want to send questions or comments at any time, I've been a cyber security practitioner that is I've been doing forensic investigations and malware analysis, and all of those kinds of things for about 11 years. But about five years ago, I decided to go back to school, get my PhD. And at that time, I got very interested in incorporating science into the cybersecurity disciplines that I had been practicing for a long time, and it's really made. Be an advocate for that because I felt like it was under taught and underutilized and that we needed to bring more attention to that topic. I keep active with the scientific community and the book that I'm writing essential cybersecurity science will look at some of these scientific Concepts that were talking about today and then I will have chapters like, like digital forensics that go into particular implementations of forensic Aura of science for malware analysis and engineering. And sort of lots of disciplines that hopefully would apply to your particular everyday life.

Because cybersecurity science has started to gain some attention in the community. I'm certainly not the only one talking about this and that's great. The three conferences or the three workshops you see on the screen have been around for a couple of years. The one on the top left from use, NYX has been around for 80 years already and it focuses every year on new papers and new tools and new techniques test beds. Even for improving Science particularly as it applies to testing, software and doing experiments the one at the bottom of the laser Workshop where laser stands for learning from authoritative security. Experimentation and results has also been going on for a couple of years and is a small Workshop of researchers and practitioners primarily who talk about their results in the last year. And hot sauce, the Hot Topics in the science of security takes this from a sort of academic approach. And we'll get into this a bit later. But they focus on the sort of fundamental, what I would call axioms of computer science and we'll talk more about that later.

So why cybersecurity science? Let's start with an example. So here's a screenshot that I captured yesterday from a free antivirus called ad-aware. And this on this page there, trying to tell you about why their product is better than another and I don't know about you, but this, this sits scenario comes up for me from time to time where I have to help choose a product to buy or to deploy in our Enterprise and so forth. What I wanted to point out on this page is that these numbers have been presented in a way that makes this product look very good and it's the same thing you would do if it was your product too. But let's ask some sort of scientific questions. So in the three products they're comparing, they say of these three. How many missed files? How many files did this antivirus fail to identify as malicious? I've been 393 samples. Well, if you know anything about malware on the internet, 393 is a very, very tiny number. And a statistician might say, is that even enough for this to be significant? That's it, that's an interesting question to ask. It also in the diagram says that outperforms. It's free peers but it only gives two peers their Well, turns out, there are many other free antivirus out there. Right, Microsoft makes one Panda antivirus makes one Komodo. So how does that compare to all the ones that they didn't list? The other thing that's missing completely from this slide are what I would call false positives? How many times did that antivirus say that a file was malicious? When it was totally totally fine that doesn't show up on. Sort of marketing slide at all. And I worry that marketing hype and the use of science can sometimes convince people of things that aren't really there. And this is one reason why understanding the scientific method is is useful.

So why science? You're all very busy people. I'm a very busy person. Why should we take time out of our day? The things are already doing to secure our networks and build process. Interesting products. Why should we add yet? Another thing, while I'm going to give you a couple of reasons first, I think science is respected. I think the majority of the population sees scientific inquiry scientific results. In a very positive light. People respect, scientists Sheldon Cooper there, right there. Only reason the Big Bang. One of the reasons. The Big Bang Theory is a popular television show, is that people respect science. There was a National Science Foundation report that came out a couple of years ago and they said there's been a significant interest in promoting the idea of applying scientific principles to information security, right? So they call out our area of interest. And what's more scientific research can really help convince your boss or your audience or the public, who's buying your product about the Value of your results. This is a really good thing for you because it helps make your life better.

Number two, scientists, sexy. Maybe not the the number two, you expected me to say, but I think many non scientists really desire to understand it, to be part of this field and it goes back to that respect. I would say, lots of people have this perception real or not but science is sort of dry and boring and geeky and maybe that's true to some degree stereotypes. Often have. Grain of truth, but science is really becoming a thing of admiration.

Number three science provokes curiosity, I think Information Security Professionals. Myself included are sort of naturally curious people, they ask good questions. We really crave information and science is a vehicle for asking questions and gaining information. It's very satisfying to sort of understand the deeper principles of what's going on and why and making things better.

Number 4, science, creates and improves products. Many of you I'm sure are in Industries where you make and sell things. And even if you don't, even if you do open source or you do sort of internal projects, we can make them better with science and I'll show you how as we go along.

Number five cybersecurity or cybersecurity science is hard. Well, this kind of seems counter intuitive and sort of not obvious. Why would you do something as it was hard? Well, I think if it was easy if it was obvious then everybody would already be doing it. We wouldn't have to have this conversation or we wouldn't need to do science at all. The fact that it's it is hard sort of implies that we need to bring some attention to this, for example. One of the really challenging problems in cybersecurity is. How do you understand an adversary adversarial modeling? How are people going to attack? My product is a really hard problem, but it's also very interesting and that has a lot of fun, sort of projects that that a, that a researcher could take on.

And the last one that I've come up with so far is that science advances knowledge. The human race for eons right since the beginning of time has tried to generate knowledge. Grows a body of information that we know about things and cybersecurity science is no different. It also helps us sort of distill or get rid of what many people would call folk wisdom in cybersecurity? Why do we do things? Well, because we've always done it that way. Or because my teacher told me to do it, Cybersecurity science, gives some proven methods, right? Some some fundamental truths that people really lack today.

So when is cybersecurity science, and when a science that sort of appropriate thing to add to your life, is it, when you're building a new smartphone app, is it if your job is to do sort of intrusion detection, and find hackers everyday? If you look at malware, every day, is there a place for science? Where, if you're, if you do, big data, sort of log analytics, all of those kinds of things. There's an interesting paper published a couple days ago called, attention, DK in science, And it basically said that there's too many scientific studies, there's too much data for people to understand and that we should consider perhaps how carefully and how much information or how many scientific studies we publish? Well, I see some grain of Truth in that. But what I really encourage you to do is look for opportunities that you're not thinking about today. For whether there is a place for the scientific method in what you're doing doesn't help answer questions. Like what if we did? At this other way or why did we Implement a secure protocol versus not? Let's compare those kinds of things. Certainly, I'm not telling you to sort of drop everything and take of the scientific method. As the only thing to do in your life to make make it take so long for you to code your new program. That this is all you have time for. It's a balanced level of effort. And the ultimate thing is that you have to ask yourself, can you afford not to do this, right? If if science can help you find bugs in your code and if it can help make our networks more secure, well then why wouldn't we do it? The sort of central motivation for why people do designed scientific method at all, is to find error, is to root out, are is the phrase that I've seen and we should want to do that too, right? We should want our tools to be better and our security to be better. And like I've said, it also validates the work that you do. That's a very important reason.

All right, let's get into some particulars. I don't have time to go through everything. You might want to consider about the scientific method, but I'm going to try and give you enough to tell east of whet your appetite. So lots of public companies names that you recognize how to research Labs, that are devoted to improving the products that those companies, sell that give General contributions back to science. Even if it doesn't improve that company's product, right? So Microsoft research is a very well-known name, they present at conferences, but they also roll their scientific results into products like, Hotmail and the three that you see on the screen are ones that I could pretty easily come up with. Now, it's sometimes hard to trace scientific inquiry into how that manifests itself in a product, but the fact that these research labs are very vocal about what they're doing is, is a, it means that they recognize how valuable this is.

All right, so what we've talked a little bit about science and the scientific method but I haven't actually told you what it is yet. You might think for your think back, when was the last time you heard these words, right? Maybe you had a class in college about the scientific method. Maybe it hasn't been since elementary school and you might have had really good experiences. You might have had really terrible boring physics experiments. I don't know, but I'll remind you sort of what the general principles are. First, you could call the scientific method, a body of knowledge and I put an asterisk there because it used to be that science. The word science meant a body of knowledge. That's generally not accepted today it you know usually encompasses the set of techniques so science and the scientific method, the application of techniques to the body of knowledge is used to test hypotheses against empirical reality. Well, empirical reality are things that you can observe or investigator experiment. It's just kind of a fancy way of saying that. And the scientific method is just a structured way of looking at the world. It's not meant to be the only way. There are certainly other ways that you can gain knowledge. Common sense is one. Deduction would be another mathematics. For example, is deductive, because there are things that are just assumed to be true, you don't have to do tests to find. Some of the axioms of mathematics.

The scientific method goes back. Quite a long ways. To First mention is probably in 1620, Francis Bacon wrote a book and the work of decart also is part of this sort of old philosophy and history of the scientific method and the Oxford English Dictionary. If you want a dictionary definition says that the scientific method is a method of observation or procedures based on scientific ideas or methods especially in empirical method. That is underlying the Made of Natural Science since the 17th century. Kind of all the things that we just said. The scientific method also contributes, not only to the Practical implementation of cybersecurity, which is what we care about. But also the sort of theoretical underpinnings if you're interested in more of the philosophy of science, there are some really good books. Out one. I'll mention is from Hugh gosh and it's called the scientific method in brief and I've encouraged you to check that out.

So, just by way of comparison, where does cybersecurity sort of lie in the branches of science? Here are some examples, so cybersecurity is not a natural science. It doesn't fall in that bin, the things like biology and chemistry. It's also not a formal science, right? Well, we use a lot of mathematical techniques, particularly in encryption cybersecurity itself is a field, not a formal science, also not a social science. Although because cyber security is a very In human-driven discipline, we draw a lot of expertise from things, even even including economics and criminology but cybersecurity sort of Falls with computer science and things like engineering and medicine as you know as an applied to science. So in applied science is something where you have a sort of practical application in mind when you're doing your work, the opposite of applied to most people would be called basic researcher basic science. And what that means is that you're trying to gain knowledge. You can gain understanding sort of fundamental, truths of the world, but you don't have any particular application in mind no immediate benefit. And both are very useful. Both are very important and computer, science and medicine. You'll see. I asked by put stars Because they have both, they have unapplied aspect, and a basic science aspect. There are fundamental truths in computer science about the theory of computation. But particularly in things like cybersecurity, right? Be the implementation, the Practical deployments are, what really matter. Why would we do it? If we didn't intend to deploy things?

Now, I've talked to some people who say, well, yes, there might be science, but what about this sort of art? What about the skill in doing something? When people talk about the art of cybersecurity generally? What they mean is, well, I have a lot of experience, right? I have knowledge, I've done that, I've had practice to hone my skill and that's why I am a, I am good at my job. Think about this, in terms of food to science, right, science in the kitchen. This is a really old book. The one you see on your screen room, 18. D3. And I thought that subtitle was very interesting, it says, a scientific Treatise on food substances and their dietetic properties together with a practical application of the principles of healthy cookery and a large number of original palatable. And wholesome recipes, I sort of hope someday there's a cybersecurity science book with that's kind of subtitle. But like I just said, what good is it? If we have Reticle cybersecurity knowledge, without some practical implementation and I think practice and Theory very much feed each other.

So let's talk about theory and practice. The, the picture that you see there is from the Wright brothers and there's a great quote that says about whether research comes before practical developments or not. It says, well the Wright brothers designed a plane before there was any theory of aerodynamics, right? There was practiced before there was even the theory of the aerodynamics and it's in my opinion, cybersecurity followed that, sort of similar trajectory. Yes, practice actually might run a little bit ahead of the theory and that's fine and one very much field feeds the other, right? They go hand-in-hand. When we do when we have our practice of cybersecurity raises, really cool. And interesting questions about. Well what can we test? What can we prove? What could actually be turned into Theory and so on?

One of the reasons for this sort of Disconnect between theory and practice between people in Ivory Towers, right? In people in the real world is that there aren't very many of these true axioms that I mentioned that things like mathematics have. Those don't really exist in security and sort of despite decades, right? We've been doing security and computers for a really long time. Our community hasn't been able to articulate to or uncover the sort of building blocks that you might expect from a field that's as mature as arches. A couple of years ago, in 2011, the US government put out, this work, that was called trustworthy cyberspace. And strategic plan, for the federal cybersecurity research and development program. And one of the things they call loud is that establishing scientific principles upon which to base trust. Insecurity is desirable and bringingscientific rigor. Very particularly to our cybersecurity domain was important. And as a result, they created the science of security Organization, which you can find at that website on the screen. And that group does something a little bit different than what we're talking about today. There are thinking more from a theoretical perspective with an eye towards implementation but they really want to know. What are these fundamental building blocks that underpin our discipline.

The first aspect that I want to talk about in terms of the scientific method is falsifiability and you'll see our good friend. Mr. Einstein there who has this quite famous quote, that says experiment. No amount of experimentation can can ever prove me, right? But a single experiment can prove me wrong. Now, Einstein was a theory guy, right. And he understood that experimentation this route of implementation of the scientific method. We're talking about can really show the wrong. Use of a theory. There's a philosopher of science Karl Popper and he talks about how do you distinguish science from non-science. And what he talked about is the sort of demarcation is falsifiability and falsifiability isn't that your hypothesis or that? Your idea of what is true is false. It's that if that hypothesis is false you can demonstrate its falsehood and we'll give some examples in a little bit to make that a little more clear. But if you say that something is unfalsifiable in science, which are basically calling the dis pseudoscience and I'm still looking for a great example. And if you have any on cybersecurity pseudoscience, I would love to hear them. You see them a lot in other domains but I'd be really interested in your thoughts about pseudoscience in our domain.

So the scientific method. I'll put all of these up here at the same time. He's one that you'll recognize very easily and it sounds like a very basic framework and it really is. It's the implementation and the application, that becomes very complex, and all of these seemingly simple steps in the scientific method. Again, applied in many different ways and many different situations. It's the fact that you have a standard methodology for doing things. That makes your the rigor in your work, really effective. So we'll go through the, I won't delve into each step at this point because we're going to go through how to do them all in your life and that's a little more useful.

As I was thinking early on about what the steps in the scientific method where I sort of hearkened back to the secure software development life cycle. If you do any software development, there are sort of equal number of best practices. This sort of methodology that you use in developing secure software and I thought well there's a sort of very interesting analogy here between that life cycle and the scientific method similar similarities And what I would caution you to say is that, yes, both of these are very defined structures. The adjectives that we use to describe them are very similar but just because you follow the software development lifecycle, well that doesn't necessarily mean you're doing science or the scientific method but it is admirable that both sort of have defined processes and that gives a very high quality result at the end and that's the reason that the they've emerged over time. So the systematic sort of Supply and quantifiable approach, not only gives us secure software, but the the similar steps that you see in the scientific method mirror it very closely.

So, in addition to those, five steps are a number of principles that apply to all of the steps in the method and let's go through them, sort of being in turn. The first one is that you want your scientific experimentation to be objective. And what that means? Or what I mean by objective, is that you want? Fair experimentation. That's free from bias. And we'll talk about bias in more detail later that you consider all of the data, right? You're not just cherry picking the things that look good to you. And not just looking at data that validates, what you want to be true, right? If your hypothesis is true, only because you've selected data that confirm it. Well, that's not objective.

Number two, we want our experiments to be falsifiable. We talked about this a moment ago, it must be possible to show that your hypothesis is false. If your hypothesis is that can only be true or there's no way to show that it can be false. That's not a good eye baucis.

Number 3, you want your experiment to be reproducible and this is sort of what you think it would be and that it should be possible for other people to reproduce your results and the process that you use to get them. If you're the only one in the whole world who can do the experiment you did, and nobody else can can reproduce it. Well, that's not good science. And so you need to go. You need to take steps to make sure that other people can be produced your work.

The fourth is that you want your work to be predictable. When I say that what I mean is that the results of the scientific method can be used to predict future outcomes in other situations? So like I said that just means that you can predict other other things, you can extrapolate the lessons that you've learned that you've that have come out of your scientific inquiry to other situations.

And the last one is that you want your your work to be verifiable. So, nothing is accepted until it's verified through observations and experiments. If we're just making stuff up, right? We're not doing the scientific method. The verifiability is the actual experimentation that you're doing to show the results that you've achieved.

So scientific rigor, I was looking for a graphic for this and I thought, well, child coloring outside the box, sort of perfectly illustrates what I'm what I'm going to talk about so hopefully you'll agree scientific rigor is is the term. We use to describe the sort of thoroughness the carefulness. The accuracy of what you're doing rigor is a sort of commitment to the scientific method and it paying attention to the details again being unbiased in your work. But it's a spectrum it's not an all-or-nothing, kind of thing, is it okay if you decide you don't have time or there's no there's no benefit to following all the steps of the scientific method in your particular situation. Well it depends right. I hope if you're building software for a hospital or for nuclear command and control that science is really important to you and that you are very careful. You have a lot of scientific rigor if your boss pays you for the number of lines of code Code you write and doesn't actually care about how effective your are efficient. Your algorithm is, well, maybe your left, you will be less rewarded at least in that regard for being very rigorous in your scientific investigation. So, take your personal situation into account. It's not that people will look down on you for having less rigor in some situations. But do I would encourage you to do as much as as as possible in your Situation, not only did feel good about the outcomes that you get, but to get stronger products in the meantime.

So I mentioned human factors a couple of slides ago. Cybersecurity is a very human Focus discipline, right. The only reason we have to do cybersecurity is because there's people and people play a role in cyber security in three different ways. First, we are the developers, right? We create the things that protect networks, we create the software, that's the target even of these cyber attacks, so developers play of crucial. Old there, one piece of the cybersecurity sort of universe. The second are the users of all of our systems, right? Anybody that sit down in front of a computer plays, a role in cyber security. If they open email, if they visit websites, they play a very important part because we have to understand, how do they make choices? How did their choices impact to the security of a system and all of those kinds of things? And finally, there's the adversary and the adversaries of cybersecurity are also people, right understanding how they make choices just like users. Well, they make choices in very different ways but being able to model how an adversary is going to attack. A system is a really hard problem, but it's very useful if you make fitness trackers, for example, and your job is to secure the fitness tracker. Well, how are people going to try and attack that product understanding that? Is a huge field of cybersecurity. There's lots of science that can be done about how do we understand our adversaries on adversarial modeling. I was just looking at a blog post while we were waiting to start today on adversary simulations and there's some great papers out there that talk about how to do this.

The other thing as a scientist to think about is what are the, what are the biases in us as scientists. And the ones that I've listed here are just a sort of a smidge to give you a taste. When we talk about bias as you may or may not know these are sort of errors in our thinking, right? They cause us to be irrational or to have inaccuracies in our results, and we want to get rid of bias to have Very well-meaning and an accepted scientific discipline. So just as an example right the first one I have here is confirmation bias and confirmation bias is explicitly. Looking for information that confirms your preconceptions, your hypotheses, your beliefs. And what it does is it leads to just to statistical errors. So the results that you get from your science. Are just wrong, right? You've only looked for data that confirms what you're looking for and this is this is a very human thing. It's a very hard thing to overcome but recognizing that it exists is certainly the first step. I finished a book a couple of weeks ago called Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman and it has a lot of great information about bias. He's very good especially at the second one on overconfidence to talk about. If you don't see data, you're likely to only likely to think that what you see is all there is that's the the acronym that he uses it's a very these are all natural tendencies and again, just be aware that they exist and you'll have better science as a result.

So we are going to talk about how some some aspects of doing your own bit of science. That's what we're going to go to next. The first thing that you have to do is come up with a hypothesis. Now, here's an example of a hypothesis. How I built a malware analysis solution. How quickly can mine malware analysis solution? Analyze a hundred pieces of a hundred files, right? Potential malware? Well let's ask ourselves first is this a good question good question sound easy and this is something maybe I really care about knowing but it turns out it's a really hard thing to do to ask good scientific questions.

And it turns out this is not a good scientific question, why? Well, for one thing it's not falsifiable, it's also not a testable statement, how quickly is not something you can test, you could run a bunch of Trials and you Say well it took me 5 minutes or whatever it takes but it's actually not a good hypothesis. So what about? What if we said Can my solution analyze a hundred files in 10 minutes? Well now you have something that you can test, right? This is a testable proposition I think that's a much better question. It makes for a much better hypothesis. You can also prove it wrong. Right. Can my, my my solution analyze a hundred thousand. Ten minutes run. Some experiments turns out. No, it takes 11 minutes. That's really good. At least you have. That's a result right? In science. Even if you disprove your hypothesis, that's still a good result. I actually think more people should publish and tell the world about the things that that, that hypotheses. We're disproved instead of just all the good things, all the positive results.

So when you you read papers which is one place to learn about science, the scientific results of the world, you'll often see something called the null hypothesis. And I wanted to mention this only because it is something you'll run into and it might be unfamiliar. It's often written in a paper as H 0, and the null hypothesis is a claim that there's no relationship between some two variables. That you're sort of looking at. So here's an example, my null hypothesis might be malware families exhibit. No human discernible visual similarities. If I draw a picture of the malware based on my algorithm, there's no human discernible similarity and my my other hypothesis, my alternative hypothesis says, well, the opposite malware images belonging to the same family appear, very similar, maybe in layout and texture. It doesn't have to be. That the null hypothesis is the opposite. This can actually be a problem but you want to be able to accept either the null hypothesis or your alternative hypothesis in the end.

Now I do learn a lot from and I think people can learn a lot from this about the scientific method by reading papers. It's definitely not the only way and I'm not trying to say that or not trying to say that your goal in life has to be to write papers, but they are kind of instructive and we're going to go through. Example, here. And what I want to point out in this one is that hypotheses in papers are kind of hidden, the kind of obvious skated now. This paper was one on user interfaces and the researchers were looking at, can you modify user interface? So that users attention immediately goes to important information on the screen to make them to have them, make better security decisions. So, for example, if you get a dialog box and you visit a website and the dialog, Boxes is about should you install a browser? Plug-in? Well, that's kind of a dangerous choice and these researchers were looking at, how do you make those dialog boxes more secure by making people look at the right thing and what do you see on the screen now is a snippet from the abstract of that paper? And what they say is that we found that these inhibited, The Trackers yada yada. Yada reduce the likelihood. So this is the result, right? They found out this is true. The hidden hypothesis behind that is that, that these the changes that are going to make will reduce the likelihood. Now they could have found the opposite, they could have found, they did all this work. Nobody, the users didn't pay any attention and it didn't work at all. And they could have published that the point being. There are hypotheses in almost every paper if you just look very closely. And sometimes you have to rearrange the words like we found That that the things were going to test will reduce or will increase security by such and such an amount. But as you read scientific papers, I would encourage you to try and find the hypothesis in the paper.

The Next Step topic. I want to, I look at these, what is a fair test? Now, you might immediately think, well, he's going to talk about good experiments and in the colloquial sense, right? People say well, that's a really clever experiment that thing that you did. That's really interesting or That's really important. Well okay. Those are great goals but that's actually not what I'm talking about here. When you do experiments, a lot of times, you'll do a whole bunch of tests. And what I'm cautioning you about here is that you can only change one variable in each test at a time, you have to keep all the other conditions, the same. This is the only way to achieve a fair test.

So, the one we have on the screen here is just an example that I made up, but a really important one that people often overlooked and that's sample size. So, let's say that your company does a cybersecurity campaign, for all thousand people at your company and its to educate people write about not to click on the spear fishing and not to open the emails apart from people, they don't know. And you want to figure out you want to scientifically measure? Was this campaign a success? Well, how many people do you think you have to interview or survey to find out if there was a success? Right, is it all thousand? Most people don't have the time or the resources to look at every possible piece of data in the, in the, in the study. And so, they sample and data sampling is a really hard problem and lots of people would go about this problem and say, well, I'll ask the people to five people who I can see from my cubicle. Well, did it work? That's not a very scientific technique and it turns out statistics has a lot to tell us about how big your sample size has to be. And if you Google the words, sample, size calculator, you'll actually get online calculators to help you. Answer the question on the screen. It'll ask you some some questions. How much confidence do you want to have in your output? Do you want to be 95% accurate? Maybe plus or minus 2 percent? Right? The kinds of things that you see in presidential elections that say we assess, right? We surveyed the population and with a ninety percent certainty plus or minus 5%, this is what we found and that's because they only surveyed a sample of the population. So if we want a 95% confidence plus or minus, a 5 percent margin of error, you would have to look at 278 employees out of the thousand of your company. And what that gives you is a statistically significant result. If you only looked at two people, well, the results that you get, you can't generalize to the whole population, there's you just didn't look at enough people. There's not enough statistical power in the in the group that you looked at. But if you look at 278, you can be 95% confident that this applies to all the people in your company. Hopefully, that makes some sense needless to say, you should make sure you have a big enough sample size for the for the test that you do.

Alright, so you do some experiments and even while you're doing experimentation, how do you know if things are going well? Well, you do that by looking at the data and this is called exploratory data analysis. And what that generally means is we want to sort of see visually what are the characteristics of the data we're looking at and lots of times, just graphing, them will tell you a whole lot right up front. If you look at this one, this is from a paper. A few years ago now, 2007, I think that was looking at botnets and if you look at the graph on the left, you can see that there's sort of two peaks. And that told to the researchers right away, there were two families of botnets. In this particular study, we're on the right, which is a different year. There was only one. And so looking at the data drawing a really simple graph can tell you a lot about about your data. It also can tell you if the experiment you're doing is running into Problems are you seeing things? You didn't expect here are some other sort of made up graphs but the shapes of the graphs tell you a whole lot about the data, we would call these distributions of data. Now you probably have some idea going into the experiment. What do you think it will? Look like, should there be clusters of dots on the graph? Like the bottom right? Or is that totally unexpected? Those unexpected things might be a problem with your Or it might be that what you thought is totally different than what the real data looks like.

And there's a lot of sort of complicated statistics that can help you figure out what does this data mean. How can I draw conclusions from my data? And I would encourage you to make friends with the statistician. That's that would be my take away for this. Statistics is a very powerful discipline and one that really can help you do good science. But I can tell you, I am not on statistics expert. I know what kind of statistical tests can sort of tease out and to analyze the data that I'm looking at a particular experiment, but the details and the implementation of Statistics can be kind of dicey from time to time. But there's plenty of people who are experts in that domain that are happy to help out. The things I list here on this slide are called inferential statistics. And what inferential statistics are is, how do you draw conclusions from a larger group, the same way we were talking about sample size. Generally, you're not going to look at every particular piece of data. And the contrast to inferential statistics is usually called descriptive. Statistics descriptive statistics, just sort of describe the particular group, like, People who take an exam, right? What's the average score of all? The people who take an exam, that's a different kind of question than, for example, how, what percentage of people like purple cars? But if you say 33 percent of people like purple cars, that's a an inferential statistic that gives you that kind of result. And I won't go through all this sort of details of Bayesian inference and things like that, but go look those up. They'll help they'll help you understand how to look at your data.

Correlation and causation is something that a lot of people have heard the sort of adage that correlation does not imply causation. Right. We use that phrase for lots of situations and I bring it up here because it's actually important when you're doing scientific experiments. Just because one event sort of correlates to another doesn't necessarily mean that the one event caused the other one. Now, I'll say up front that correlated events are actually quite useful to scientists, right? They give us insights about other things to investigate the point is that is not to just blatantly except that there was causation there. Well, so how do you determine causation? Again, there are some statistical tests that can certainly help with this. The very simplest that I would start with, is to say, make sure that one thing happened to be for the other. I see this in cybersecurity papers, kind of routinely. For example, there was a study that looked at how tired do professionals in a network Operation Center. How does that affect their effectiveness of especially on Long ships? If somebody has to sit into computer for 10 hours? Are they as good in the first hour as in the last hour in detecting, and Visions into their Network. Well, lots of things can cause people to make mistakes, right? Not just because it's the tenth hour and you want to make sure that people weren't making mistakes when they first came in on the job, right. One thing has to happen before the other for that causation to occur.

So let's say you've done some science, you have some results. So what, how do you put put that out? Put to work. Well the the primary goal you might be doing, there are the primary goal for. You might be to improve a product, that's a great goal. That's a perfect reason to do science is to build something better, right? I'm totally happy with that. I think that's a totally legitimate reason. Maybe you want to protect your results with a patent, that's a fine reason and there's no reason that you shouldn't do that. I would not call that a sort of selfish intention as some people might. But lots of things that are patented still go on to the public domain and still result in very reasonable products. Another thing you might want to do is to release your code and release your data and sharing code and data. I think is really important in science because it lets people reproduce what you're doing. Now, lots of people have argued with me that. Well, my code isn't good enough to put in GitHub or on sourceforge. I'm not, I don't want to fix all the bugs, and I don't want to be responsible for it. Well, that's a fair complaint. That's a fair consideration. I would say clean it up as much as you sort of can We need online that benefit outweighs the risks of putting it out there.

Lots of people are hesitant to share the data that they used in science, because maybe it's intellectual property. Maybe it's sensitive information, particularly in cybersecurity the data that we're using contains personal email, addresses, or Bank credentials, and all these kinds of things. But anonymization of data, is a pretty well understood discipline. And the more that we have common data that all of us can use Use the better science in general gets and there's a bunch of people now, trying to build repositories of data network data pcaps, user interactions. All of these kinds of things. And if we all use similar data, at least, we can compare our results, right? Because we've used the same data. Another thing you can do is to is to do documentation. This is important because it lets the world know. What did you do? How did you do it? What choices. Did you make even just posting that on a Blog writing an article, there's different levels of pain. I would say to whether or not you want to go to a fancy journal or you want to present at a conference. All of these are totally legitimate ways to different degrees of work that you can get your scientific results. And so you should really think about how are you going to share what you did?

So in the course of my thinking, I've put together a checklist and I'll caution you up front. That this isn't meant to be the only way of doing things and the checklist isn't meant for you to go one step after the other. What it's really meant to be our considerations, to make sure you haven't forgotten important things to have waypoints. You know, how far along in the process. What else do I have to do? But the fact that your experimentation will be totally Dynamic and your creativity Will trump anything that I Think of that's very, that's very fine and I won't read through all of the checklist but I do want to sort of point out some of the considerations of things that we've already talked about and things that we won't have time to get into detail on today.

So when these first five, I'll say the number three talks about doing some background reading, figure out what's already out there, lots of people start to do scientific experiments. And it turns out somebody already has that result. Now is doing is replicating, an experiment, a good thing to do, absolutely. But you have to do it consciously, and if you just are re are coming up with something that's already been done. I want you to waste your time if people already know sort of what the outcome is. So be conscious. Take a little effort to read. What's out there? Google Scholar is a very easy search engine to use to look for, especially academic work papers that are out there, so that you can see what's been done in the area. You've you're interested in, I would tell you that you don't have to be the expert in every part of your experiment, I'm sure you're an expert in your domain and I totally respect that. But assemble a team if you need it, right? Get somebody who's a statistic statistician. If that would help do the experiment better. I routinely pull people from other domains, especially psychologists or economists. And those kind of things that just are not my area of practice. But bye-bye jointly going after an experiment, even if they're just a consultant that's really useful and it makes my results much more applicable.

The testing of your hypothesis to doing experimentation. That's really the bulk of this method of the scientific method. And there's lots of steps sub steps, right? Some of which I lived here. That talk about how do you test the hypothesis? One thing about the third third, bullet down talks about identifying an environment where you're going to do, experimentation I'll get into this a lot more in the book, but I'll say here that you have lots of choices if you want to do. Experiments on your laptop. That's actually what a lot of people do. They look at their code, right? They run tests or simulations on their laptop. Desktop virtualization is very widespread and that's a pretty good choice. Now, why would you choose to use a cloud or, why would you build a laboratory for doing experimentation? Well, there's trade-offs right? There's trade-offs in cost in the Scale of the experiment that you can do, but also in this sort of realism of what you're doing. It's possible that somebody could argue with me that we should do all of our experiments in the real world, right? Anything that we're doing on a laptop is, is simulated data or it's stored data from from The Real World, but it's not the actual real world. And I think there's plenty of reasons why we should look at the real world because it's, it's so useful, right? And it's it's nothing is made up, but it can also be very dangerous if you want to look at how malware spreads. You don't want to do that on the internet, right? It's dangerous. It's probably illegal doing it in your lab is a much better choice. But there's trade-offs, and that's sort of the point I want to make, is that you have two choices in these next two.

I'll point out that you should look to see if your results are reasonable. This is the sort of second half of number 10. And when we talked about graphs, we talked about exploratory data analysis, that's what I'm getting at here. Does the results that you're getting look legitimate. If they look totally bogus, you should use your gut and sort of go back and check that. The infrastructure you're using is working, but the software, you wrote is working. The reason, ability test, right? That sort of gut instinct, you should pay attention to that. The documentation, we've talked a little bit about and there's there's a number of bullets here that go. Towards that end, third from the bottom, I say, try and explain your conclusions, including why you did or did not accept your hypothesis. Lots of people sort of gloss over this and they'll talk about what the results were. But not why they why they accepted it. And subsequently, the next bullet talks about explaining the limitations of your data, I gave that example from the the paper abstract a while back that talked about being very honest about the limitations of the results and I would encourage you to do that. People will not look down on you for for explaining. The shortcomings or particular parts of the problem that you just didn't have time or didn't have the resources to look at. So be honest in those kinds of things. The last part of the checklist, these last three, I'll reiterate number 14, which is to make your code and your data as public as possible. Again, I recognize this isn't something you can do every time and there are plenty of extenuating circumstances, but your default should be to make your code and the data used in your experiment public.

All right, we have come to the final section and that is the application of some of these things to digital forensics. This is an area. I know. Well, and in the book will go through. We go, I go through a whole bunch of other topic, domains like, malware analysis and so forth. Digital forensics just makes an easy case for us to look at today. So, forensic science, digital forensics is a really interesting one to look at because by definition digital forensics require science. The definition that most people use is that it's the application of scientific tests and techniques in the detection of crimes or at the very least in a court of law. Well, the fact that we require science really makes this useful here, right? Because we have to look at it. The printed digital Friends Community is quite large. Lots of people are practitioners in this field but there are small dedicated group of researchers who support those practitioners by looking at new tools, new ways to collect data new ways to analyze forensic data and those kinds of things. The digital forensics research Workshop DF R WS. Is one place where researchers present result in this field. They have an annual annual Bring now in the United States and in Europe and I encourage you to check out that they are at DF R. WS dot org. There are a couple of Standards, the daubert standard is something that came about from United States court case. And if you want scientific data, especially in digital forensics accepted in a court. There are standards by which you have to meet if you want to, if you want to claim that what you have is, scientific knowledge and I would encourage you to look at these, these court cases the daubert versus Mary Dowell Pharmaceuticals and there's another one called the fry standard and that's from a court case called Fry versus United States, both of which are used in different parts of the United States but they both talked about how do we present scientific data in court. And they say, the scientific methodology is based on generating hypotheses, testing them to make sure they can be falsified and that the knowledge you present as an expert witness in court, has to be derived by the scientific method, the second bullet on the slide talks about the very particular ways, that, that a judge or a jury determines. If the things that you say are valid in that court and they are that the data are the techniques, you're presenting, must have been tested. There must be peer-reviewed, that's things like Journal articles and so forth. There must be known error rates and controlling standards. There has to be and there has to be General Acceptance in the scientific Community. If you just write a python script and it produces data and you go to court, they're going to call you out on whether there's General acceptance for your python script.

So I think it's useful to look at a paper that's been published and we'll look at it on the next Slide. The title of this paper is language translation for file paths and you'll see why they what that means in a second. But in the abstract that I'm going to show you, I want you to look for the author's talking about, what are their contributions, the scientific principles of public data, and what was their sample size of their accuracy? And do they give you enough detail? Failed to reproduce what they did. So let's take a look. Hopefully, you can read that. The very first sentence of the abstract says forensic. Examiner examiner's are frequently confronted with context in languages that they do not understand and they could benefit from machine translation into into their native language. Right there. Up front is the implied hypothesis framed in a in the context of what the problem is and what the results. They're going to present here. 're are. But the very first sentence gives you that gives you that context. The next sentence talks about why is this a difficult problem? Lots of people claim to do science to do the scientific method and scientific experimentation, but they're actually choosing problems that are not interesting and they're they're not actually very hard. It's the problems that you pick should be difficult. They should have non-trivial answers and this sentence explains why the topic of this paper. Non-trivial like the difficult problem and they say it's difficult because you only get a little bit of text in a file path and figuring out what language that little bit of text is, is really hard. The next part of the abstract talks about what are the results. And in this case, these researchers built a working prototype. They built some software. And that's what they say is that we built a prototype implementation. That does the things that they presented, which were hard, which is figure out the language and translate into English words from foreign languages. I'll skip down a little bit to the part that talks about test data and about the accuracy. And even in the abstract they say, what the size of the the test data was which was 50 million files by iPads and the accuracy of how well they do with their prototype, which is 90, well, let's see. 90.4 accuracy on some and 93.7 on others. What they say right up front, how good how accurate their solution is? You have to read a little bit deeper in the paper to find out. Where did they get those 50 point 1, 5 million file paths, but they actually use a Data Corpus that's available to researchers. It isn't here in the abstract and perhaps you noted that but it is data that you can get if you wanted to try and reproduce what they did or you want to develop an alternative solution, you could get the exact same data and you could compare your accuracy directly against theirs. And that's a really important thing to

so some general advice, particularly in forensics, if you think that your software could ever be used in court, These are the considerations for you to take into account, not that you have to make sure you check off every list. But know that if somebody goes to testify with your python script, these are questions, they're going to have to be able to answer and you can think about that as you're doing scientific work, if you are doing that in digital forensics, one is to make you tools available. They could be free and open-source or they could be commercial as long as people can get to them. If you publish your source code on GitHub, right? Then it's already publicly available. Seeking peer review and publication that goes to the fact that the courts want to make sure that other people have validated what you did and peer review, which is having an anonymous reviewer. Look at your, your explanation, in your implementation really gives a lot of credibility to the things that you did and it should make you as a scientist. Feel good. That there are people out there that really respect the approach that you took in the results that you got. So that's a really great. The third one is that you want to make sure you figure out what the error rates for your software are no software that I've ever seen is is 100% reliable. Save, maybe, hello, world. That I wrote as a freshman in college. So do some tests figure out what the error rates for your code are and even if they're not a hundred percent, that's not what the courts are looking for. They're not looking for a hundred percent, they're just looking for the fact that you can identify and show what the error rate is. And the last thing that goes to these sort of daubert, fry standards is to use accepted procedures. Open source is one way to show the procedures that you used, and it might not be necessary for every tool that you create. But following best practices also goes towards accepted procedures. And that's, that's really important to do. I didn't listen to your reproducibility and repeatability but they're sort of implied by the by the four pieces of advice during

so last thing, let's walk through a sort of made up experiment in forensics just so we can see what the considerations are. We're not going to go into these in depth but I want you to think about how you would do an experiment in forensics. So let's say you want to know what the time required to to do a forensic timeline. That is Taking somebody's taking my hard drive for example. And being able to say well this file was created at such-and-such a time and you want to compare whether it's faster to do on a workstation or on a big Hadoop cluster in the cloud and your hypothesis. Is that it'll be 75% faster. If you do it in the cluster So we can only change one variable. We talked about this earlier, right? We want to do the exact same test with the same data where the only thing that we change is the platform that would allow us to definitively identify. That the only difference was the cluster. Now we're going to run into trouble in this in this experiment because The computers say in a cloud, right? If I'm using the Amazon web services, those computers are just different than mine, right? And so when I document my results, and when I am trying to explain this is somebody, I have to account for those differences and I have to be as similar as possible. The other thing I want to do is make sure that I communicate not only the differences in the platform but document the test data that I'm using make that test data available as we've said and document what our results. Start. Now I didn't actually run this experiment but I made you a fake fake graph. And in this graph, one of the, the barlines is the desktop and the other one is the cloud and I do it for different discs sizes. So I can compare that, let's say this was over the course of many experiments. But what you visually see, what sort of pops out is that the cloud is not better. Well, the the cloud is better but it's not 75% better. So You've disproved your hypothesis. That is okay. If you were to get exactly 75 percent, I would be very suspicious, right? How did you know that? That's exactly what it would be. But we can also modify our hypothesis. Now that we've now that you've tried it and say, well, I wonder if something else, right? I wonder if more a bigger Cloud resource would actually get me to 75%, or I wonder if the cloud gets better for bigger, hard drives versus smaller ones. In the end, you have success, right? Success in the scientific method, is being able to accept or reject any hypothesis. Just because you didn't get exactly what you thought going in, doesn't mean that you failed. So I would say keep doing these experiments. That's right, you're gaining knowledge. You're following a very established process, that's the whole goal. Other people can understand what you did, and you can understand what they did. The more, you understand the scientific method, the more you'll appreciate the work of other scientists and be able to see the the crazy claims. Like we saw at the very beginning, with the antivirus, you'll be up. You'll have a better understanding for what's real and what's not, what you should question. I appreciate you sharing in the presentation today and look forward to hearing your your additional questions even after the presentation and your own experiences with science and the scientific method.
