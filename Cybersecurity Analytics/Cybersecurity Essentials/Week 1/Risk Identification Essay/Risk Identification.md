Companies around the world use the concept of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to allow for intercommunication often at a large scale. With this exchange of information, software developers are able to extend their applications to use services, and consumer devices are able to access user information stored on a server. Though similar to a doorway, anyone is able to walk through it, especially since this doorway is accessible from any network the the API connected to, like the internet. T-Mobile in mid-August, 2021 was made painfully aware of API abuse when a data leak spanning over 50 million users was detected. On August 17, 2021, T-Mobile announced the breach stating a hacker bypassed API protections, and was able to request customer information such as first/last names, social security numbers, and driver’s license information.

The attack on T-Mobile starts well before the digital landscape even gets involved. According to the attacker John Binns in a Wall Street interview “This breach was done to retaliate against the US for the kidnapping and torture of John Erin Binns (CIA Raven-1) in Germany by CIA and Turkish intelligence agents in 2019” (2021). In a 2020 memorandum Binns attempted to sue the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for “‘previously [being] the target of attempted recruitment into the CIA through blackmail,’ and since that time, the CIA has surveilled, stalked, and tortured him” (United States District Court for the District of Columbia, 2020). However this case was dismissed on July 27, 2020 due to improper filing, improper use of cases such as _Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents_, lack of legal authority for emotional distress, as well as various immunities provided to the United States government. After this case, on December 19, 2020 a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request was submitted to the CIA for gangstalking operations, and GPS tracking or spyware which was responded with “the CIA can neither confirm nor deny the existence or nonexistence of [these] records... such records is itself currently and properly classified and is intelligence sources and methods information protected from disclosure” (Central Intelligence Agency, 2023). Binns was unable to obtain any relief for his sought after claims, and was ultimately denied access to any documentation regarding his case. Due to the lack of progress on this issue, Binns opted to use skills he already posses, and attempt to steal data from T-Mobile.

The attack started in July with John Binns from his house in Turkey connecting to a data center in Washington state where he accessed more than 100 company servers over the course of a week, according to the Wall Street Journal (2021). Binns performed the attack by targeting an unprotected router, and with some help was able to get login credentials for databases, as well as production, staging, and development servers soon after (Greig, 2021). During this period, Binns was selling identifying user data that he copied, though T-Mobile’s CEO Mike Sievert claims no financial information was extracted (2021). T-Mobile was alerted to the active leak by cybersecurity company Unit221B who spotted a sample of the stolen T-Mobile data being sold on the dark web for about 6 Bitcoin (equivalent to about $280 thousand) (Greig, 2021). Binns claimed the attack was spearheaded on his own, but it remains unclear who helped Binns obtain SSH login credentials for the servers he logged into. Additionally, it is unclear how the vulnerabilities were patched, but given that Binns’ access to the servers was disabled, at least the problematic router was likely patched.

While a forensic analysis was taking place, T-Mobile released updates on their newsroom starting with August 16, 2021 where they stated approximately 8.6 million prospective, current, and former customers were affected. As T-Mobile continued the investigation, 46.05 million more customers were found to be affected, including some Metro customers. T-Mobile began offering McAffee’s ID Theft Protection Services, recommending T-Mobile’s “Scam Shield” service, and mandatory PIN and password resets for affected customers.

Looking past customers, according to Sievert in 2021, T-Mobile is partnering with Mandiant, with consulting from KPMG LLP to “… take our cybersecurity efforts to the next level…”. Mandiant, a subsidiary of Google which has been merged to be a part of Google Cloud, offers incident response and consulting (Google). Mandiant started with T-Mobile when the attack was detected, and moving forward is aiming to be more proactive, in conjunction with KPMG. KPMG is a multidisciplinary technology company, offering services in the financial, procurement, and cybersecurity sectors (KPMG, 2024). Sievert does not make precise statements about how the two companies will be assisting T-Mobile, particularly around Mandiant. Though given KPMG’s roll of consulting, is likely hardware and software infrastructure.

These improvements were seen as a necessary action by Sievert due to the reliance on T-Mobile infrastructure in the United States. In Q4 2024 T-Mobile made up about 30% of cellular subscriptions (Statistica, 2024), particularity in large cities where T-Mobile has substantial 5G mid-band infrastructure (T-Mobile, 2020). In 2020, the US census tracked just over 258 million adults living in the United States, and Pew Research Center found that in early 2021 85% of adults have smartphones meaning approximately 66 million adult customers use T-Mobile for their personal smartphones. This figure excludes smart, child, government, and business devices. This was seen as one of the primary goals for Binns when he chose T-Mobile to attack “We did it to harm US infrastructure…” (2021). Therefore by observing the quantity of data that T-Mobile posses, a data leak has an extremely high risk of affecting millions of users, proven again by Binns after stealing 106GB of user details (Abrams, 2021).

After the 2021 T-Mobile hack, T-Mobile had a relatively quiet year in 2022 presumably while T-Mobile, Mandiant, and KPMG were in high alert, and lessons were fresh. However T-Mobile was put to the test in 2023 with three data leaks occurring, the largest affecting 37 million accounts. Though unlike in 2021, T-Mobile was successfully able to mitigate the attack, with the attacker only able to get spotty access to billing addresses, phone numbers, date of birth, and account numbers which is largely publicly available from other vendors (Gatlan, 2023). T-Mobile did accidentally expose customer data to other customers, which included credit card info, and home addresses via a software bug. Based on public knowledge from T-Mobile’s data breaches, it appears that T-Mobile’s security is improving, but an attack vector impossible to eliminate will forever be T-Mobile themselves. Training, software testing, and slow software roll outs will have to continue to be a part of T-Mobile’s cybersecurity plan moving forward to ensure that everyone is on the same page about data security, and software exposes the exact data it needs to at any point.
