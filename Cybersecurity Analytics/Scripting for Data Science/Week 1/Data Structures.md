Data organization can be a key part to the speed and efficiency of data analysis, so choosing between structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data should be an up-front endeavor. The difference between these three methods of data organization can be described as the range from traditional sentence structure (unstructured), to a table with specific data requirements (structured).

Structured data requires that rules be fulfilled, for the data to be valid. Examples of this according to [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/structured-data/), are SQL databases, inventory management, and web form results. While structured data doesn't satisfy the day-to-day for people communicating to each other, it does allow the data to be easily read, and used by people and computers alike. [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/mysql/what-is-mysql/) claims "SQL is the most common standardized language used to access databases," making structured data the most common database datatype since the "S" in "SQL" literally stands for "Structured".

According to [Deloitte Insights](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/analytics/insight-driven-organization.html) in 2019, out of the 1,000 large companies (over 500 employees) polled, only 18% of have been able to effectively use unstructured data, like that found in social media content. The inability to use this data is in part because of "loose" and inconsistent nature of unstructured data. For example, "The bus hit Timmy," and "Timmy was hit by a small bus" portray the same information, but the data is in a different order and contain different details. The problem is compounded for businesses because businesses often times use relational databases internally to store data, which is a structured data type. Thus converting photos, audio clips, and typed text is a required additional and labor-intensive task. However as [MIT Sloan](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/tapping-power-unstructured-data) reports, retail in the mid-2000's was successfully beginning to parse and link unstructured customer data like customer emails, foot-traffic, and voice to specific customers. In my opinion, a fascinating [example](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/shopping-habits.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1&hp) of this was Target Statistician Andrew Pole's "Pregnancy Prediction" algorithm, correctly guessing a high schooler was pregnant before her father knew.

Semi-structured data, being a mixture between structured and unstructured allows for some of the formatting from structured data, but relaxes some of the consistency rules. Because the rules of structured data are relaxed, a semi-structured datatype like email collections with sender-recipient graphs, metadata and text content is a suitable example of how semi-structured data may be convenient, claims [Monash University](https://handbook.monash.edu/2024/units/FIT5212?year=2024). However, the pitfalls of unstructured data shine through since JSON documents, a form of semi-structured data, can be malformed or even misinterpreted as ThePrimeagen demonstrates in the YouTube video "[JSON, I hardly know 'er](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTjYjSEGHek)" where JSON values are shown to be inconsistent with their converted JavaScript values.

For analysis, I'd say it largely depends on what's being worked on. For example, if it's known that you may need to reach out to third party services, it may be useful to store data into a dictionary, which is easily exportable into JSON for an API call. Otherwise, I tend to prefer structured data, as I'm able to improve performance across large data sets. for example, if I know the data I need is every third entry in an array, I can skip to the exact points in memory I'd need. If I attempt to use a dictionary, the computer's then required to do hundreds or potentially thousands of lookups, wasting time. This approach shined through when I was helping my significant other work with unstructured data to track particles through sewage. Once the data was organized, we were able to cache it, and query it at will.
